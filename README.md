# Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys

## Introduction
In this project, I take on the role of a data analyst. I work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

## Goals
My goals are to clean and analyze the data to answer the following questions to stakeholders:
* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

## Data
Below is a preview of a couple columns I'll work with from the dete_survey.csv:

* `ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
* `SeparationType`: The reason why the person's employment ended
* `Cease Date`: The year or month the person's employment ended
* `DETE Start Date`: The year the person began employment with the DETE

Below is a preview of a couple columns I'll work with from the tafe_survey.csv:

* `Record ID`: An id used to identify the participant of the survey
* `Reason for ceasing employment`: The reason why the person's employment ended
* `LengthofServiceOverall. Overall Length of Service at Institute (in years)`: The length of the person's employment (in years)
